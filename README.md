## Synopsis

This is a work in development. The "Reference Finder" portion of the program is
now functional as a macOS command line tool.

A user interface for macOS is being developed.

Future additions will include analyzing the picture of a crease pattern and
automatically generate a folding sequence to construct some or all creases.
