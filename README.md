## Synopsis

This is a work in development.

Dr. Robert J. Lang's [ReferenceFinder][1] is a great tool for finding references
on a piece of paper. This application expands on ReferenceFinder and lets the
user specify points and lines directly on the paper (point-and-click). The user
will be able to load a picture of a crease pattern into the program and manually
draw the paper's bounds directly on the crease pattern.

Future additions will include automatically detecting lines and points on the
loaded picture of a crease pattern and generating a folding sequence to
construct some or all creases.

## Environment

This application is written for macOS in the Swift programming language.
Because it is a work in development, the current version of Xcode is required to
run the program.
